If you are a user then this $0 is not for you:
go to the GEMS home dir; If needed GEMS $0 will 
spawn GMML building.
This is for building GMML in isolation! You can wrap GMML here
using swig but interfacing with the wrapped lib will be up to you
GEMSHOME should be set to the parent of the gmml directory.
After GMML is built the next step is testing, first
run cd ./tests/, then run ./compile_run_tests.bash
*************************************************************
Options are as follows:
\t-c\t\t\tClean all files from previous builds
\t-j <NUM_JOBS>\t\tBuild GMML with <NUM_JOBS>
\t-o <O0/O2/OG/debug>\tBuild GMML using no optimization, 2nd
\t\t\t\t\tlevel optimization, or with debug symbols
\t-w\t\t\tWrap gmml in python using swig
\t-d\t\t\tUsed for debug functionalies
\t\tno_wrap\t\t\tPrevents the makefile from having a
\t\t\t\t\t\tswig wrap target and prevent python/swig
\t\t\t\t\t\ttoolinginstallation checks
\t\tinc_tests\t\tLets us generate a compile_comamnds.json
\t\t\t\t\t\tthat also includes all of the test source code files.
\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is useful for linting and running various tooling
\t\t\t\t\t\ton our codebase. Eventually will also be used to check
\t\t\t\t\t\tour test coverage but that is in the future. Note this

#Proper cmake use is to use the build_type flag. We mess with specifics in the
# actual cmakelists.txt file. Listed below are the different build types in
# normal english. Ty stack overflow

#1. Release: high optimization level, no debug info, code or asserts.
#2. Debug: No optimization, asserts enabled, [custom debug (output) code enabled],
#   debug info included in executable (so you can step through the code with a
#   debugger and have address to source-file:line-number translation).
#3. RelWithDebInfo: optimized, *with* debug info, but no debug (output) code or asserts.
#4. MinSizeRel: same as Release but optimizing for size rather than speed.

#Below are the compiler flags passed for each build type before they were
# overloaded in our cmakelists.txt
#1. Release: `-O3 -DNDEBUG`
#2. Debug: `-O0 -g`
#3. RelWithDebInfo: `-O2 -g -DNDEBUG`
#4. MinSizeRel: `-Os -DNDEBUG`

#4. MinSizeRel: `` 					(NOT USED)
